# Blay's Chat Bot

## What is this mod?
This minecraft fabric mod turns you into a chat bot. It is fully client-sided, and unless the server has some kind of invasive spam protection or disallows you being a chat bot (which is quite likely), it can be used on any server you can imagine. Originally made for [oldfag.org](https://oldfag.org) (uses it's green text feature). You'll still be able to chat normally while running this mod.

## Wer downlouds???
This mod is still in development. You could compile it rn and start to use it, but it probably ain't gonna work too well. Once I fully finish my works on that mod, I'll release it's compiled version on modrinth.

## Working commands
- `;help`
- `;github`
- `;hello`
- `;gayrate`
- `;lastseen`
- `;ping`
- `;iq`
